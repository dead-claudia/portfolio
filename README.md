# Portfolio App

A basic, in-progress portfolio app I'm working on. It's an [Electron-based](http://electron.atom.io/) app, and [Thallium](https://github.com/isiahmeadows/thallium) is used for the tests.

- `app/` contains most of the main, mostly front-end code.
- `debug/` contains debug-specific code.
- `templates/` contains the (incomplete) work on handling templates, including the format.
- `tests/` contains...well...the tests. :smile:
